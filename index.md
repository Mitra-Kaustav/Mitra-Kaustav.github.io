## Hello, I am Kaustav Mitra.
### I am a PhD student in the department of Astronomy at Yale University.

My research is in the confluence of studying equilibrium dynamics, empirically constraining galaxy formation theories, and inferring cosmological parameters from the large-scale structure of the universe. I work with [Prof. Frank C. van den Bosch](https://campuspress.yale.edu/vdbosch/) on these topics. We developed **Basilisk**, a Bayesian hierarchical likelihood inference tool that maximally extracts information from the smallest and most non-linear scales in a galaxy redshift survey. It forward-models the kinematics and abundance of satellite galaxies around their respective centrals, to constrain the statistical link between galaxy and dark matter halo properties with unprecedented precision. We combine it with more conventional statistics of galaxy populations to break degeneracies and simulataneously constrain cosmological parameters along with the galaxy-halo connection.
